#### Setup  

Create `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add: 
`PORT=5070`    
`NODE_ENV=development`   
`BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`    
`COOKIE_KEY=somecookiekey`  
`MONGO_URI=yourMongodbUrl`  

Add applications in your developer accounts on Google, Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Spotify, Amazon.  
Create application inside of each developer account, add Redirection/Callback URLs which correspond to the server routes  
Copy Client(app) ID and SECRET and add them to `.env` file in the root directory of the project

#### Authentication with Twitter [TwitterStrategy](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-twitter/)  
Create [new application](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/apps/new) in the twitter developer account  
Navigate to **App Details**->**Authentication settings**->**Edit**  
Make active  **Enable 3-legged OAuth** option and add **Callback URLs** it should correspond to the routes where the users will be redirected after they logged in, for example: `http://localhost:5070/auth/twitter/redirect`  
Ensure that  **Terms of service URL**  and  **Privacy policy URL**  fields have values, if not - [generate](https://app.privacypolicies.com/wizard/privacy-policy) URLs and add them.   
Enable **Request email address from users**options and Save settings.  
Also `includeEmail: true` should be included in the `passport.use( new TwitterStrategy( {} )` in the `passport.js` config file (done) in order to receive userâ€™s email in the response-profile  
Once [app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/apps/) is created navigate to the **Keys and tokens** on app details and click `View Keys`. Copy `API key` and `API key secret` and add them to the `.env` file in root directory of the project:   
`TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=API key`   
`TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=API key secret`
